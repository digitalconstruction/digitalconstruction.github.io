<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p> Digital technologies are increasingly used in all stages of construction lifecycle.  Existing buildings and sites
can be mapped with scanning technologies, designs created using the tools of building information modeling (BIM),
design and management information consumed at the site through mobile devices, the progress of construction
monitored with sensors (position, occupancy, activity state) and scanning devices, and facility management
based on data gathered by building automation systems (BAS) and sensors. </p>

<p> Digital construction means that large volumes of heterogeneous data will be produced at each lifecycle stage. It is
a significant challenge to process and interrelate different pieces of data into a meaningful and accurate overall
picture that is operationally useful and understandable to both human and automated agents. The purpose of the Digital
Construction Ontology Suite is to address the semantic level of this challenge, by providing the essential concepts and
properties faced in construction and renovation projects, thus paving the ways to the ultimate integration of
information from different decentralized sources. </p>

<h2>Overview of the contents of the ontologies</h2>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Scope</b>
	<p>
	Digital construction ontologies aim to capture the relevant objects and properties (relationships and
	attributes) that can be referred to by people or systems during the management and execution of construction or
	renovation projects. This includes physical and spatial entities, temporal regions, information contents,
	agents, activities, and groupings of objects. </p>
	<p>
	The primary aim in Digital Construction Ontologies is to define the upper-level concepts (such as those shown
	in boxes on the right) while providing the possibility to create additional ontologies that extend those
	definitions with additional more specific concepts (for instance, concepts like those shown outside of boxes on
	the right).  
	</p>
	
      </td>
      <td>
	<img width="550" src="dico-scope.png">
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Common properties</b>
	<p>All identifiable entities can be associated with multiple different <em>identifiers</em> and
	<em>classifications</em> to facilitate the linking to other construction information, both at the instance
	level and at the category level.</p>
	
	<p>In addition, there are some important other relations:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>All objects can be decomposed into <em>parts</em>.</li>
	  <li>The parts of activities are called <em>subactivities</em>.</li>
	  <li>Information objects are <em>about</em> other identifiable objects.</li>
	  <li>Groups can contain any identifiable objects as their <em>members</em>.</li>
	</ul>
      </td>
      <td>
	<img width="550" src="dico-common-properties.png">
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Activity flows</b>
	<p>Activities are related to several different kinds of ingredients (often called flows) that have been studied
	and identified in the field of
	lean construction. The flows can be classified into transformed objects, material batches, equipment, labor crews, workspaces,
	information objects, and environmental conditions, and each activity can have several flows in each of these categories. Activities
	require that the relevant ingredients are in a 
	proper state before the execution (preconditions) or during it (such as resource reservations). Moreover, activities transform
	the state of some of the ingredients as the result of their execution (effects). </p>

	<p>
	An essential goal is to be able to link
	different entities to activities since the interest in construction management is in the progress of activity execution
	but direct observations can mostly be collected from other objects than activities themselves (e.g., sensor data about
	positions of objects or people, occupancy or locations). A proper linking will enable the derivation of activity
	execution data from the observations about the linked objects. </p>
	
      </td>
      <td>
	<img width="550" src="dico-flows.png">
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Multi-context data</b>
	<p>
	Different aspects of construction - such as building objects,
	resources, or activities - can be represented in multiple different contexts and often it is interesting to
	compare the differences between those contexts. Building-related examples are as-designed and as-built contexts for BIM models,
	or more comprehensively the contexts for different LODs (levels of detail/development). Typical activity-related contexts are
	planned and actual data of project execution. </p>

	<p>
	Multi-context data is represented using the named graphs of RDF
	datasets. It is an orthogonal mechanism that allows any objects to be associated with different properties - or
	even different structures - in different contexts. If needed the multi-context mechanism allows the
	recording of all differences between planned and actual activities. In addition to the traditionally recorded
	planned and actual start and end times of activities, it is also possible represent actual activities that do
	not appear in the plans at all (so-called improvised activities). 
	</p>
      </td>
      <td>
	<img width="550" src="dico-contexts.png">
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Variables and constraints</b>
	<p>Much of the essential information in project management or construction
	management can be represented in the form of <em>constraints</em>, and over significant periods during project execution, the
	plans can have incomplete information about the exact values of some properties, such as start and end times of
	tasks, resources assigned to tasks, locations of entities, and so on. To enable the interoperable sharing of
	such crucial and common information, the ontologies include a possibility to associate a variable to any
	property of an object and to represent constraints between variables. This representation is completely
	orthogonal and can be used to enrich objects and properties defined in any existing ontologies.
	</p>
	<p>
	In the example on the right the properties of an object (<tt>shipment1</tt>) as defined in the ontology are shown in 
	blue color. Each of those properties is associated with a variable (in red color). The variables again are
	associated with constraints (in green color) that limit their possible values.

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Integration with the broader Semantic Web</b>
	<p>Digital Construction ontologies are designed to observe the
	Linked Data principles, thus enabling the decentralized publication of construction data, which is essential in
	construction projects.
	</p>
	<p>The ontologies use
	or are aligened with well-known existing ontologies, as shown in the figure on the right (import relations are
	shown as
	solid and reference relations dashed lines). The Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) is imported as the
	top-level ontology, the BIM models can be 
	provided in ifcOWL or BOT, and concepts from other ontologies such as OWL-Time, PROV-O, FOAF, QUDT, SSN/SOSA, and Saref
	are used as needed. 
	</p>
	<p>Further alignment with related efforts such as Industrial Ontology Foundry will be
	explored. </p>
