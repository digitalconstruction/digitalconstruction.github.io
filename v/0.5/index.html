<h2>Terminology for the representation of digitalized construction and renovation processes</h2>

<p> Digital Construction Ontologies have been defined to work as an enabler of semantic interoperability between systems
in the construction and renovation domain. It defines basic terms related to built assets, building design, construction
project planning, and construction planning, including the agents, resources and spatio-temporal aspects. The definitions of the ontologies rely heavily
on standardized or otherwise established ontologies; the correspondances of Digital Construction Ontologies with other
ontologies are provided explicitly in separate alignment modules. </p>

<p> The specific objective is to address the representation of digitalized construction processes. Digital technologies
are increasingly used in all stages of construction lifecycle, from scanning, building information modeling and
procurement to supply-chain management and construction management. Mobile devices, sensors and imaging solutions
provide a flood of instantaneous data from the project execution. Digitalized construction projects can employ a wide
range of task-specific point solutions that can significantly enhance the productivity and quality of individual
tasks. However, the improvement of overall construction productivity depends even more on what happens <em>between the
tasks</em>: how the information produced in one task can be utilized in other tasks. By improving the semantic
interoperaability, the Digital Construction Ontologies are an enabler of smoother information sharing and eventually
also higher productivity. </p>

<h2>Contents of the ontologies</h2>

<h3>Overview of the scope</h3>

<p> Digital construction ontologies aim to capture the relevant objects and properties (relationships and attributes) that can be referred
to by people or systems during the management and execution of construction or renovation projects. This includes physical and spatial
entities, temporal regions, information contents, agents, activities, and groupings of objects. </p>

<p> The overall scope of Digital Construction Ontologies is shown in the figure below. Most concepts in the figure are from the Entities ontology. The large
grey boxes show the areas that specific ontology modules in the
Digital Construction Ontologies extend with more specific concepts.  The concepts shown in the
light-blue boxes in the middle are those defined in Digital
Construction Ontologies, the ones in light-grey boxes belong to BFO ISO and the green ones are from other
ontologies. The direction of the arrow shows the superclass relation and a two-way arrow means equivalent classes. The texts near to concept
boxes suggest possible subclasses.  </p>

<img width="80%" src="dico-bfo.png">
<p>
The top-level organization of the Digital Construction Ontologies ontologies are provided by BFO. It divides the entities into two classes,
<i>Occurrent</i> (things taking place in time, such as processes) and <i>Continuant</i> (things taking place in space, such as
physical entities or spacial regions). From the perspective of construction management, <i>Activity</i> - a subclass of
<i>Process</i> - captures the intentional efforts of an <i>Agent</i>. An <i>Agent</i> can be a <i>Person</i> or an
<i>Organization</i>, and can have <i>Capabilities</i> annd assume <i>Roles</i>. The construction process is
characterized by a set of <i>InformationContentEntities</i>, such as <i>Designs</i>, <i>Plans</i>, <i>Contracts</i> and
<i>Issues</i>. 
</p>

<h3>Labeling: identifiers and categories</h3>

<p> Due to the fragmented nature of construction, there can be multiple parties and systems that manage any particular entities at some
phase of their lifecycle, and that give identifiers, classifications or other labels to those entities. The exact nature and number of such
labelings is highly context dependent. To promote linking and integration between systems in construction projects, the flexible capability
to represent the labelings of entities is crucially important.  </p>

<p> In Digital Construction Ontologies, any <i>Entity</i> can be associated with a number of <i>Identifiers</i> and <i>Categories</i>. They can be <i>identifiedBy</i>
have Globally Unique Identifiers (GUID), and often multiple of them, each given by a different stage or system during its
lifecycle. Moreover, objects can also have multiple local identifiers, such as a room number in a building or a control point number in a
building automation system or an identifier in another information system.  </p>

<p> Objects also <i>belongTo</i> different categories in different classification systems, such as OmniClass, Unicode, CoClass, etc. They
can also belong to categories in other information systems, such as being an identifiable entity in a particular project.  </p>

<p> The actual nature and number of identifiers is dependent on the context of an object, and it is not possible to define separate
properties for each of them in an ontology in a generic way. Therefore both identifier and categories are represented as objects. An
identifier has a label (<i>hasLabel</i>) that is a string and it is in relation to some scope (<i>hasScope</i>) which is a
<i>Category</i>. For globally unique identifier the scope is a global category such as <i>:Guids</i>, and for local identifiers a more
specific category.  </p>

<center>
<img width="80%" src="dico-labels.png" />
</center>
<p>
The <i>Labeling</i> can also be used to associate case-specific names for any entity, for instance, to be shown in the
user interface of a system that stores its data in Digital Construction Ontologies compliant manner. For example, in a location breakdown structure
the locations can be associated with names that make sense for the people working in a particular stage of construction. 
</p>

<h3>Composite entities and space-time</h3>
<p>

</p>
<center>
<img width="80%" src="dico-composite-spacetime.png" />
</center>

<h3>Activity-flow relations</h3>

<p> <i>Activities</i> have several different kinds of ingredients - often called <i>flows</i> - that have been studied and identified in the
field of lean construction. The flows can be classified into transformed objects, material batches, equipment, labor crews, workspaces,
information objects, and environmental conditions, and each activity can have several flows in each of these categories. To be executable an
activity requires that its ingredients are in a proper state before the execution (preconditions) or during it (e.g., resource
reservations). Moreover, the activity transforms the state of some of the ingredients as the result of its execution (effects) - this being
the purpose of executing the activity in the first place.  </p>

<center>
<img width="50%" src="dico-flows.png">
</center>

<p> An essential goal is to be able to link different entities to activities since the interest in construction management is in the
progress of activity execution but direct, sensor-based observations can mostly be collected from other objects than activities themselves
(e.g., sensor data about positions of objects or people, occupancy or locations). A proper linking will enable the derivation of activity
execution data from the observations about the linked objects.  </p>

<center>
<img width="50%" src="dico-activity-flows.png">
</center>

<p>
The figure above presents the relations in Digital Construction
Ontologies ontologies to represent the flows of activities, defined in
the Digital Construction Entities and Processes ontologies. The table below gives a detailed description of
the flow relations. (Note that <tt>dice:hasParticipant</tt> is equivalent to BFO's <tt>'has participant'</tt>, and <tt>dice:occursIn</tt> BFO's <tt>'occurs in'</tt>).

<p>
The object of an activity (using <tt>dicp:hasObject</tt> property) can be, in addition to
<tt>dice:BuildingObject</tt> also anything else that can be a focus of work, such as <tt>dice:Location</tt>, <tt>dice:Group</tt> (e.g., for
procurement and logistic activities), <tt>dice:Activity</tt> (e.g., for
managerial activities), or <tt>dice:InformationContentEntity</tt> (e.g., for design and planning activities). 
</p>

<p>
It should be noted that these properties as such allow only a partial representation of the relations of activities and flows. They tell
what entities are the ingredients of an activity but do not specify what should be the state of an entity before the execution of an
activity (preconditions) or what would be the state after it (effects). The representation of these states require the concepts from the
Variables ontologies described below. 
</p>


<h3>Multi-context data</h3>

<p> Different aspects of construction - such as building objects, resources, or activities - can be represented in multiple different
contexts and often it is interesting to compare the differences between those contexts. Building-related examples are as-designed and
as-built contexts for BIM models, or more comprehensively the contexts for different LODs (levels of detail/development). Typical
activity-related contexts are planned and actual data of project execution. </p>

<p> Multi-context data is represented using the named graphs of RDF datasets. It is an orthogonal mechanism that allows any objects to be
associated with different properties - or even different structures - in different contexts. If needed the multi-context mechanism allows
the recording of all differences between planned and actual activities. In addition to the traditionally recorded planned and actual start
and end times of activities, it is also possible represent actual activities that do not appear in the plans at all (so-called improvised
activities).  </p>

<center>
<img width="50%" src="dico-contexts.png">
</center>

<h3>Variables and constraints</h3>

<p>Much of the essential information in project management or construction management can be represented in the form of
<em>constraints</em>, and over significant periods during project execution, the plans can have incomplete information about the exact
values of some properties, such as start and end times of tasks, resources assigned to tasks, locations of entities, and so on. To enable
the interoperable sharing of such crucial and common information, the ontologies include a possibility to associate a variable to any
property of an object and to represent constraints between variables. This representation is completely orthogonal and can be used to enrich
objects and properties defined in any existing ontologies.  </p>

<p> In the example on the right the properties of an object (<tt>shipment1</tt>) as defined in the ontology are shown in blue color. Each of
those properties is associated with a variable (in red color). The variables again are associated with constraints (in green color) that
limit their possible values.  </p>

<center>
<img width="70%" src="dico-variables.png">
</center>

<h3>Integration with the broader Semantic Web</h3>

<p>Digital Construction ontologies are designed to observe the Linked Data principles, and consequently to enable decentralized publication of
construction data by the diverse parties in construction projects.  </p>

<p>The ontologies use or are aligened with well-known existing ontologies, as shown in the figure on the right (import relations are shown
as solid and reference relations dashed lines). The Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) is imported as the top-level ontology, the BIM models can be
provided in ifcOWL or BOT, and concepts from other ontologies such as OWL-Time, PROV-O, FOAF, QUDT, SSN/SOSA, and Saref are used as needed.
