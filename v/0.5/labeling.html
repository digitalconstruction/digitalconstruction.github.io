<h1>Labeling of entities in DiCon</h1>

<p> In DiCon, all entities can be labeled with multiple different identifiers and classifications, following the
philosophy of <a href="https://www.semanticarts.com/gist/">gist ontology</a>: the labels are represented as data,
instead of defining large numbers of new data properties or classes for them. Flexible labeling is important capability
since labels can communicate the users as well as external systems what the entity in question is and what kind of
entity it is.  A simplified diagram of the most important classes and properties is shown below. </p>

<h2>Identifiers</h2>

<h3>URIs as primary identifiers</h3>

<p> Each independent entity represented according to DiCon ontologies has a URI as its primary identifier (Please note that
there can also be subordinate entities that are anonymous and represented as blank nodes at the RDF level). Apart from
identifying the entity, the URI can be used to retrieve the description of the entity.  </p>

<p>Each URI is unambiguous (refer to one real-world entity) but not necessarily unique (there can be different URIs that
refer to the same real-world entity).  For example, <tt>http://company1.com/ElmStreet1</tt> and
<tt>http://project1.com/Building1</tt> could be two URIs that refer to the same real-world building. Each of the URIs
may return information </p>

<pre>
<code>
http://company1.com/ElmStreet1 --&gt
    http://company1.com/ElmStreet1 a dice:BuiltAsset ;
                                   dica:hasOwner http://example.com/Owner1 ;
                                   ... 

http://project1.com/Building1  --&gt
    http://project1.com/Building1  a dice:Building ;
                                   dice:hasAgent http://company1.com/Contractors/Contractor1 ;
                                   ...
</code>
</pre>

<p>These URIs can be declared with <tt>owl:sameAs</tt> axiom as references to the same entity. In a RDF database with
proper support for reasoning, the result is a merging of properties from the two sources: </p>

<pre>
<code>
http://company1.com/ElmStreet1 owl:sameAs http://project1.com/Building1 .

http://company1.com/ElmStreet1 --&gt
    http://company1.com/ElmStreet1 a dice:BuiltAsset, dice:Building ;
                                   dica:hasOwner http://example.com/Owner1 ;
                                   dice:hasAgent http://company1.com/Contractors/Contractor1 ;
                                   ... 
</code>
</pre>

<p> The description above is meant to remind that in Linked Data systems URIs are the primary identifiers of
entities. They can be made retrievable, they are required by the Linked Data Principles, and the reasoning works based on
equivalence defined by them. However, they are not sufficient for all practical settings related to user interaction or
cross-system access.  </p>

<h3>Additional identifiers</h3>

<p> Any real-world entity can have distinct identifiers in different systems and contexts. Often it is essential to know
these identifiers to be able to refer to the entity in user interfaces, when accessing entities in those systems or
using them in the specified contexts.  Some of the identifiers are globally unambiguous (such as GUID or DID) and some
locally unambiguous. Examples of local identifiers are room numbers in a building, control point numbers in a building
automation system, user names in a communication application, identifiers in a local database, and so on. Many of the
commonly used identifier types are not URIs; in general, they can be any strings. </p>

<p>In detail, any instance of the class <tt>dice:Entity</tt> (or some of its subclasses) can have additional identifiers
of the class <tt>dice:Identifier</tt> connected to through the object property <tt>dice:isIdentifiedBy</tt>. 
</p>

<p>
An example of a labeling is the following. The primary identifier of an entity is <tt>http://company1.com/ElmStreet1</tt>
and it has an IFC GUID and an asset identifier as additional identifiers. The residental unit
<tt>http://company1.com/ElmStreet1Apt1</tt> in the building has the apartment number as a local identifier in the scope
of the building. It should be noted that the identifiers are always with respect to some scope that can be an
identifier category or an entity which hosts other identified entities.

<h2>Classifications</h2>

<p> In ananalogous fashion to identifiers, classifications using <tt>dice:Category</tt> can be associated to entities
through the object property <tt>dice:isClassifiedBy</tt>.  There are many different classification or coding systems -
OmniClass, ETIM, CoClass, Talo2000, or GS1 codes - that specify the types of entities. The following example shows the
use of classification with product data: </p>

<pre>
<code>
@prefix : &lthttp://company1.com/&gt .
@prefix dice: &lthttps://w3id.org/digitalconstruction/0.5/Entities#&gt .

:ETIM a dice:Category ;
   rdfs:label "ETIM classification for technical products" .

:BSDD a dice:Category ;
   rdfs:label "bSDD classification" .

:GTIN a dice:Category ;
   rdfs:label "GS1 Trade Item Number for a class of trade items" .
    
:InternalProductId a dice:EntityScope ;
   dice:hasEntitiesFrom :InternalProductDB ;
   rdfs:label "Internal product database" .

:Lamp1 a dice:BuildingObject ;
   dice:isIdentifiedBy [a dice:Identifier ;
         dice:hasScope :InternalProductID ;
         dice:hasLabel "pr0233.98723878822" ]  ;
   dice:isClassifiedBy [a dice:Category ;
         dice:hasScope :ETIM ;
         dice:hasLabel "EC000819" ] ,
        [a dice:Category ;
         dice:hasScope :BSDD ;
         dice:hasLabel "1YlGK0inSHuO00025QrE$V" ] ,
        [a dice:Category ;
         dice:hasScope :GTIN  ;
         dice:hasLabel "012345.67890" ].
</code>
</pre>

<p>
Different classification systems can contain thousands of detailed categories for different kinds of entities. The
association of these categories to entities in a generic fasion enables to keep the DiCon ontologies simpler. The
ontologies can focus on the complexity of the domain, while the classifications take care of the variety in it.
